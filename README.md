# BeautifulBillboard

Welcome to the Beautiful Billboard CLI! This is my first project as a Flatiron school student.

This program pulls information from the Billboard Artist 100 list in the form of 'Star' objects  (https://www.billboard.com/charts/artist-100) and from the Hot 100 list in the form of 'Hit' objects  (https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100). You'll be able to see a list of stars in a compact, organized, and colorful format, with detailed information on each star available on demand. This includes a measure of how many hits each star has currently on the Hot 100 chart.

Music has never looked better!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'beautiful_billboard'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install beautiful_billboard

## Usage

Run 'bundle' from your terminal.

Then type './bin/beautiful_billboard' into the terminal to run.

Follow the prompts and have a great time!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
